# IAI-IPS Twine Cognition Prototype

This project is a prototype of the IAI-IPS Twine Cognition architecture for Artificial General Intelligence, featuring intertwined analytical ("Logos") and intuitive ("Pathos") cognitive cores.

## Features

- Simulated dual-core cognition: analytical and intuitive reasoning
- Bi-directional feedback between cores
- Demonstration scenarios: routine and urgent/uncertain situations

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Alastairian/Twine.git
   cd Twine/twine_cognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main prototype script:

```
python main.py
```

This will execute the built-in demo scenarios and print the decision process of both Pathos and Logos cores.

## File Structure

## Custom Scenarios

To try your own input, modify the data in `main.py` or create new test scenarios in a separate script.
